### Today's Topics

1. Customizing visualizations
2. Making static visualizations interactive with *plotly*
3. Creating interactive maps with *leaflet*


### Setup

Loading in our Libraries


```{r setup, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(plotly)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(leaflet)
library(sf)
library(vembedr)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
vembedr::embed_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS_zXa0prMw")
```


Read in 2023 Sustainable Development Data with *read_csv()* and *here()*


```{r, message=FALSE}
sdr_data <- read_csv(here("data/SDR-2023-Data.csv"))
```

Clean column names

```{r}
sdr_data <- sdr_data %>% 
  clean_names()
```


### Customize a Histogram

Let's start with the histogram you created last lesson with ggplot() and geom_histogram()

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(sdr_data, aes(x = goal_4_score, fill=regions_used_for_the_sdr)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


Looks Nice, but let's improve it!
  
  - add a theme with theme_minimal()
  - add a color palette with scale_fill_viridis_d()
  - add a title, x axis label, y axis label, and legend label with labs()

We start with the same exact code and add to it with `+`  
  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(sdr_data, aes(x = goal_4_score, fill=regions_used_for_the_sdr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "magma") +
  labs(title = "Distributions of SDG 4 Scores",
       x = "SDG 4 Score",
       y = "Number of Countries",
       fill = "Region")
  
```



Awesome, looking much better!

  - However, it's still a little tricky to tell exactly how many countries in each region have each SDG 4 Score
  - There's a few ways to go address this, one of them is to make the plot interactive with ggplotly()
  
### Making static visualizations interactive

Interactive visualizations are a really exciting part of data science! Interactivity engages the viewer by allowing them to explore the data in a way they cannot with static visualizations
  
  - The great part is that with the ggplotly() function from the plotly package, making interactive visualizations is very simple
  
    - First we create the plot with the exact same code
    
      - The *only difference* is that we assign the plot a name with `<-` the same way we do with dataframes or lists
      
      - Next we put the name that we give the plot into the ggplotly function
   
      
```{r}
goal_4_histogram <- ggplot(sdr_data, aes(x = goal_4_score, fill=regions_used_for_the_sdr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "magma") +
  labs(title = "Distributions of SDG 4 Scores",
       x = "SDG 4 Score",
       y = "Number of Countries",
       fill = "Region")

ggplotly(goal_4_histogram)
```



Epic! Now we can hover over the histogram and get some info

  - For example: We can see 2 countries in the LAC region have a score of 68
  
We can also double-click the boxes in the legend to only view the regions we're interested in

#### <span style="color: red;">Challenge 1</span>

Here is the code for a scatter plot you made in the last lesson:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = sdr_data, aes(x= goal_3_score, y = goal_4_score, color = regions_used_for_the_sdr)) +
  geom_point()
```

*Edit the code chunk above* that generates the plot to:

- add a theme with theme_minimal()
- add a color palette with scale_fill_viridis_d()
- add the appropriate title, x axis label, y axis label, and legend label with labs()

*AND*

- make it interactive with ggplotly()

  - hint: you will have to assign a name to the plot

```{r}
goal_3_4_scatter <-ggplot(data = sdr_data, aes(x= goal_3_score, y = goal_4_score, color = regions_used_for_the_sdr)) +
  geom_point() +
    theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "magma") +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between SDG 3 and SDG 4 Scores",
       x = "SDG 3 Score",
       y = "SDG 4 Score",
       fill = "Region")

ggplotly(goal_3_4_scatter)
```


### Creating interactive maps with `leaflet`

This takes a few fun steps to do

1. We need data on countries and their physical location on the globe

  - Lucky for us the `rnaturalearth` package has this information for us
      
    - We use the ne_countries() function to access the data and we assign it the name *world*


```{r}
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
```

- Now we have a dataframe named *world* in our environment
  
  - It has 241 locations/countries (rows) and 64 columns describing each location/country
  
  - We are only interested in 3 columns:
    
    - Country Name
    - ISO3 codes which are three-letter country codes 
    - Geometry
      - This column contains the info describing a country's physical location on the globe
      
Let's select the three columns we are interested, making the dataframe much smaller 

```{r}
world <- world %>% 
  select(name_long, iso_a3, geometry)
```

We're almost ready to join these dataframes

  - We have ISO3 codes in both of our dataframes (sdr_data and world) but the columns that contain the ISO3 codes have different names
    
    - In the world dataframe it is iso_a3
    - In the sdr_data dataframe it is country_code_iso3
    
Let's change the column in sdr_data called country_code_iso3 to iso_a3 to match the world dataframe

```{r}
# Rename a column in a data frame or matrix
colnames(sdr_data)[which(colnames(sdr_data) == "country_code_iso3")] <- "iso_a3"
```

Perfect! Now we can join

- There are many different ways to join data
    
  - Check out this [cool resource on joining data in R](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/joins.html#sec-mutating-joins)

Let's use the `left_join()` function

- We use left join because we want the 3 columns we are interested in from world to be joined/added  to sdr_data
  
  - There are 35 countries/places in the world dataframe that are not in our sdr_data. Using `full_join()` would include these countries/places in the new joined dataframe, however, all the SDG info would be NA. TO avoid this, we'll use `left_join()`
  
  - We'll name the new joined dataframe *sdr_data_world_joined* and we will join by the column the 2 dataframes share: iso_a3


```{r}
sdr_data_world_joined <- left_join(sdr_data, world, by = "iso_a3")
```

Nice!

The next 4 code chunks are slightly technical regarding the class of sdr_data_world_joined. We can check the class with the 'class()' function

```{r}
class(sdr_data_world_joined)
```

Right now, sdr_data_world_joined is a dataframe. In order to use the `leaflet` package that generates the map, we need sdr_data_world_joined to be an sf dataframe. sf stands for spatial features. Converting sdr_data_world_joined to class *sf dataframe* is easy with the `st_as_sf()` function and it allows leaflet to interpret the geometry column as something it can map

```{r}
sdr_data_world_joined <- st_as_sf(sdr_data_world_joined)
```

Now lets check the class again to make sure sdr_data_world_joined is of class sf dataframe

```{r}
class(sdr_data_world_joined)
```

The last step before mapping with leaflet is specifying a coordinate reference system (crs). There are many different coordinate refernece systmes, and here we choose WGS84

- WGS84 stands for World Geodetic System 1984. It's a global standard for measuring locations on Earth's surface. WGS84 defines a coordinate system using longitude and latitude coordinates, where longitude measures east-west position and latitude measures north-south position. This system is widely used in GPS (Global Positioning System) devices, mapping applications, and geographic information systems (GIS) because it provides a consistent and accurate way to represent locations anywhere on Earth.

```{r}
sdr_data_world_joined <- st_transform(sdr_data_world_joined, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
```

Awesome! We're ready to make a map 

- Let's map SDG 7 Scores 

  - the my_text part of the code determines what happens when we hover over a country
  
  - the `leaflet()` function generates the map from the *sdr_data_world_joined* dataframe
  
    - we specify SDG 7 scores in the "color =" argument of the function 

```{r}
mytext <- paste(
    "Country: ", sdr_data_world_joined$country,"<br/>", 
    "Goal 7 Score: ", round(sdr_data_world_joined$goal_7_score, 2), 
    sep="") %>%
  lapply(htmltools::HTML)

leaflet(sdr_data_world_joined) %>% 
  addTiles()  %>% 
  setView( lat=10, lng=0 , zoom=2) %>%
  addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.5, smoothFactor = 0.5, color = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", goal_7_score)(goal_7_score), label = mytext)
```
#### <span style="color: red;">Challenge 2</span>

Can you edit the code chunk above that generates the map to:

- Map a different sdg score
- Change the color palette from "YlOrRd" to another palette
  - Hint: [look under the RColorBrewer Palettes here](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/top-r-color-palettes-to-know-for-great-data-visualization/)
    
```{r}
mytext <- paste(
    "Country: ", sdr_data_world_joined$country,"<br/>", 
    "Goal 11 Score: ", round(sdr_data_world_joined$goal_11_score, 2), 
    sep="") %>%
  lapply(htmltools::HTML)

leaflet(sdr_data_world_joined) %>% 
  addTiles()  %>% 
  setView( lat=10, lng=0 , zoom=2) %>%
  addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.5, smoothFactor = 0.5, color = ~colorQuantile("BuGn", goal_11_score)(goal_11_score), label = mytext)
```
